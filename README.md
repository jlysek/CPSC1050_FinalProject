Hello and Welcome to my RPG game!
You will be playing a game I designed called Fallining Roulette.
There are two players in this game. First the bettor, who will
be making the decisions during the game and will have the option 
to continue playing or to take their winnings each round. The Second 
player is the dealer who will win if the bettor busts. The game is 
structured as a minimum of a $100 buy in, from there the bettor picks
either even or odd. A wheel, numbered 1-36, is then spun and if even a 
even number is selected they are paid out 1.5x and that number is taken 
off the board. This is where the falling part occurs. The number it landed on
will now be taken off the board and the bettor will then have the option to 
either take their winnings or play again with the wheel now only having 35 numbers.
If they decide to play again they can select even or odd which now the board won't 
have a 50/50 probablity. If they win again they will make 1.5x there bet+profits plus 
the previous round. So if they bet $100 the first round and won, now they have 
$150. If they decide to play again and win they will have 1.5*150 $225 and this loop
continue till the player losses or quits.
